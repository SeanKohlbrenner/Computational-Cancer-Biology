## The Evolution of Tumors

> "**Schematic representation of neoplastic transformation.**(A) The left-hand side represents regular homeostatic tissue. The middle regionrepresents a mutation undergoing a selective sweep across a population of phenotypically normal tissue. The right-hand side indicates a period of clonalgrowth, during which different mutations combine across subclones. (B) A phylogenetic tree on the right mirrors the subclonal structure in (A); the circlesrepresent mutations, and their sizes indicate the size of the corresponding subpopulation. The green subclone contains a branching process of mutationaccumulation, indicating the continual stochastic processes that underlie the approximation that is a clonal evolution tree." <sub>Beerenwinkel et al.

## Current Challenges

### Reconstruction of Genetic History

### Interpretation of Mutations

### Predictive Modeling

## The Bridge Between Computer Science and Cancer Evolution
