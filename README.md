## The Evolution of Tumors

Cancer, at its core, is an evolutionary process. As shown in the figure above, tumors are made up of many subpopulations of body cells that have mutated to the point where they no longer act or die like a normal cell would: this is how a cancer cell is created. That is all cancer cells are: mutated descendents of your own cells. Because of this we can look at cancer as an evolutionary process which may allow us to exploit its development to try to prevent or cure it.

It is believed that these mutations are ongoing over a person's life rather than occuring all at once when a tumor is formed. Researchers have even been able to observe healthy cells carrying the same mutations found in cancerous ones. This is a very gradual process and we cannot simply look for mutations in cells to correctly diagnose and treat cancer. Because
  
## Current Challenges

### Reconstruction of Genetic History

Doctors have been able to take samples of tumors to be genetically analyzed for some time now, allowing scientists and doctors to study the diversity and genetics within a tumor. This however is not enough, a single sample leaves so many gaps in understanding that can make treatment difficult. Now that scientists have developed more methods of sequencing genomes they can take more samples from many different locations which gives clearer picture of the evolutionary history of cancer. The main difficulty with these new methods is that they generate incredible amounts of data.

Until recently scientists have been unable to realistically process these large amounts of data. Computational methods are becoming more important as time goes on because they are the only way that all of this data can be interpreted. Through a better understanding of the evolutionary history of cancer cells we can better predict when it may occur.

### Interpretation of Mutations

### Predictive Modeling

## The Bridge Between Computer Science and Cancer Evolution

As you can see

The field of computational cancer biology combines the expertise of computer scientists and cancer researchers to solve, what Beerenwinkel et al. describes is, "one of the biggest biomedical research challenges of our time" (2016). 

But why should computer scientists care? I believe that this is one of the greatest opportunities within computer science available to us today. Many of us began studying computer science because of a passion for computers and technology and how they can solve any problem we throw at them. For me, and many others, this combines two passions: computer science and biology.
